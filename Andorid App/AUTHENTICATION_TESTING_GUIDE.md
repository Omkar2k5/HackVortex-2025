# Authentication Testing Guide

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
The app was showing placeholder data and bypassing authentication. This has been fixed with the following changes:

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Enhanced Authentication Check**
- Added robust authentication validation
- Checks both Firebase Auth and SharedPreferences
- Clears inconsistent authentication data
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. **Removed Placeholder Data**
- Cleared placeholder text from layout XML
- User info now populated only when authenticated
- Empty fields when no user is logged in

### 3. **Added Debug Tools**
- Debug menu option to clear authentication
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
- Proper error handling

## 🧪 **How to Test the Authentication Flow**

### **Step 1: Clear Current Authentication (If Needed)**
If the app is still showing the home page without login:

1. **Option A - Use Debug Menu:**
   - If you can see the app, tap the menu (⋮) in the toolbar
   - Select "Debug: Clear Auth"
   - Confirm to clear authentication data

2. **Option B - Clear App Data:**
   - Go to Android Settings → Apps → FinanceBuddy
   - Tap "Storage" → "Clear Data"
   - This will reset the app completely

3. **Option C - Uninstall and Reinstall:**
   - Uninstall the app
   - Reinstall from Android Studio

### **Step 2: Test Fresh App Launch**
1. Launch the app after clearing data
2. **Expected Result:** Should redirect to LoginActivity
3. **If Still Shows Home:** Check the logs for authentication status

### **Step 3: Test Login Flow**
1. Use the login screen to sign in
2. **Expected Result:** Should redirect to main activity with user info
3. **Verify:** User name and email should appear in the user info card

### **Step 4: Test Logout Flow**
1. In main activity, tap menu (⋮) in toolbar
2. Select "Logout"
3. Confirm logout
4. **Expected Result:** Should redirect to login screen

## 📱 **Expected Behavior**

### **When Not Authenticated:**
- App redirects to LoginActivity immediately
- No main activity content is shown
- User info card is empty/hidden

### **When Authenticated:**
- Main activity loads normally
- User info card shows:
  - Welcome message with user's name
  - User's email address
  - Service status (Active/Inactive)
- Menu shows Profile and Logout options

### **User Info Card Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👤  Welcome, John Doe               │
│     john.doe@example.com            │
│     Service: Inactive 🔴            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 **Debugging Steps**

### **Check Logs:**
Look for these log messages in Android Studio Logcat:

```
MainActivity: Firebase current user: [email or null]
MainActivity: Preferences logged in: [true/false]
MainActivity: Final authentication status: [true/false]
MainActivity: Authentication failed, redirecting to login
MainActivity: Authentication successful, proceeding with main activity
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **App Still Shows Home Page:**
   - Clear app data completely
   - Check if LoginActivity is properly configured
   - Verify Firebase configuration

2. **Menu Not Showing:**
   - Check if toolbar is properly set up
   - Verify menu XML file exists
   - Ensure `setSupportActionBar()` is called

3. **User Info Not Updating:**
   - Check Firebase Auth current user
   - Verify user data is being retrieved
   - Check layout IDs match code

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

### **Fresh Install Test:**
- [ ] App redirects to login on first launch
- [ ] No user data is shown
- [ ] Login screen appears

### **Login Test:**
- [ ] Can successfully log in with valid credentials
- [ ] Redirects to main activity after login
- [ ] User info card populates with correct data
- [ ] Menu appears with Profile and Logout options

### **Session Persistence Test:**
- [ ] Close and reopen app while logged in
- [ ] Should stay logged in and show main activity
- [ ] User info should persist

### **Logout Test:**
- [ ] Menu shows logout option
- [ ] Logout confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Successfully logs out and redirects to login
- [ ] User data is cleared

### **Service Integration Test:**
- [ ] Service toggle works when authenticated
- [ ] Service status updates in user info card
- [ ] Service stops when logging out

## 🚨 **If Authentication Still Not Working**

### **Emergency Reset:**
1. **Clear All App Data:**
   ```bash
   adb shell pm clear com.example.smartfianacetracker
   ```

2. **Check Firebase Configuration:**
   - Verify `google-services.json` is in the right place
   - Check Firebase project settings
   - Ensure authentication is enabled in Firebase Console

3. **Verify LoginActivity:**
   - Check if LoginActivity exists and is properly configured
   - Verify it's declared in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Test login functionality independently

### **Debug Authentication State:**
Add this temporary code to MainActivity onCreate for debugging:
```kotlin
// Temporary debug code
Log.d("DEBUG", "Firebase Auth User: ${FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser?.email}")
val prefs = getSharedPreferences("SKNHackfestPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
Log.d("DEBUG", "Prefs logged in: ${prefs.getBoolean("is_logged_in", false)}")
Log.d("DEBUG", "Prefs user email: ${prefs.getString("user_email", "null")}")
```

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the authentication flow** using the steps above
2. **Check the logs** to see what's happening
3. **Use the debug menu** to clear authentication if needed
4. **Report back** with the results and any error messages

The authentication system should now work properly and redirect to login when no user is authenticated.
